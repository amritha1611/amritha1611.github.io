# 8-bit Pixel Art Themed Potfolio Website

Made using HTML and CSS from scratch. Image Sources are pinterest and google images, I own none of the assets, except ofcourse the Avatars. Website was made as practice inspired from the exercise in Angela Yu's Web Development 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. Font is from google fonts and GIFs from giphy.


# Techniques Used:

1. CSS Centering
2. CSS Flexbox
3. HTML forms, redirects
4. Importing fonts, images and GIFs 
5. Media Queries for Responsive Design (TBD)
